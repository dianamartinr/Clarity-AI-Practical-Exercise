# Predicting Poverty using Machine Learning Classification Algorithms

In this project, we'll aim to predict from household surveys if a household is poor or not. We explore how well machine learning algorithms perform when given the task to identify the poor in a given population. The data contains 6562 surveys data from the [Predicting Poverty Competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/50/worldbank-poverty-prediction/) published by drivendata.org.
